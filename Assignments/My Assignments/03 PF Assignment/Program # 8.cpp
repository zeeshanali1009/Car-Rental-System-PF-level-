/*8. The population of a town A is less than the population of town B. However, the 
population of town A is growing faster than the population of town B. Write a 
program that prompts the user to enter the population and growth rate of each town. 
The program outputs after how many years the population of town A will be greater 
than or equal to the population of town B and the populations of both the towns at that 
time. (A sample input is: Population of town A = 5000, growth rate of town A = 4%, 
population of town B = 8000, and growth rate of town B = 2%.) */
