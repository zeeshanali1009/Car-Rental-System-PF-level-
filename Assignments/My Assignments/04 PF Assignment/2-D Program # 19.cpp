/*19. Write a program that can be used to assign seats for a commercial airplane. The airplane has 13 rows, with six seats 
in each row. Rows 1 and 2 are first class, rows 3 through 7 are business class, and rows 8 through 13 are economy 
class. Your program must prompt the user to enter the following information:
a. Ticket type (first class, business class, or economy class)
b. Desired seat.
Output the seating plan in the following form:
A B C D E F
Row 1 * * X * X X
Row 2 * X * X * X
Row 3 * * X X * X
Row 4 X * X * X X
Row 5 * X * X * *
Row 6 * X * * * X
Row 7 X * * * X X
Row 8 * X * X X *
Row 9 X * X X * X
Row 10 * X * X X X
Row 11 * * X * X *
Row 12 * * X X * X
Row 13 * * * * X *
Here, * indicates that the seat is available; X indicates that the seat is
occupied. Make this a menu-driven program; show the user’s choices and
allow the user to make the appropriate choices. */
